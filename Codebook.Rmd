The data set found in the file `tidy_data.csv` is a summary of variables from in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

From the dataset description:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAyING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

##Variable and descriptions
###Subject
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 

Variable name    | Description
-----------------|------------
subject          | ID of the 30 volunteers  who performed the activity. Its range is from 1 to 30.


###Activity
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAyING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

Variable name    | Description
-----------------|------------
activity         |  Activity type that the 30 volunteers  who performed the activity. 


It has 6 levels:
1. walking
2. walkingupstairs
3. walkingdownstairs
4. sitting
5. standing
6. laying

###Features
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz are captured. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals 
timeAccelerometer a-xyz and timeGyroscope-xyz. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyacceleration-xyz and timeGravityAcceleration-xyz) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerationJerk-xyz and timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-xyz). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerationMagnitude, timeGravityAccelerationMagnitude, timeBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcceleration-xyz, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerk-xyz, frequencyBodyGyro-xyz, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroJerkMagnitude. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-xyz' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the x, y and z directions.

- timeBodyAccelerometer-xyz
- timeGravityAccelerometer-xyz
- timeBodyAccelerometerJerk-xyz
- timeBodyGyroscope-xyz
- timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-xyz
- timeBodyAccelerometerMagnitude
- timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude
- timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude
- timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude
- timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude
- frequencyBodyAccelerometer-xyz
- frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk-xyz
- frequencyBodyGyroscope-xyz
- frequencyBodyAccelerometerMagnitude
- frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude
- frequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitude
- frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
- mean: Mean value
- std: Standard deviation
